> Weâ€™ll go over the fundamentals of Object-Oriented Programming and define terminology like abstraction, encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism in this post.

Object-Oriented Computers, or OOPs concepts with real time examples, refer to programming languages that make use of objects. Inheritance, hiding, polymorphism, and other real-world concepts are all part of object-oriented programming. The basic goal of OOPs concepts with real time examples is to connect data and the functions that operate on it so that no other part of the code may access it except that function.
